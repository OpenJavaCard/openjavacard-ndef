## OpenJavaCard NDEF

This project contains several JavaCard applets acting as NFC NDEF tags.

It is intended as a reusable library covering most usecases for NDEF
on smartcards. There is support for emulating simple NDEF memory tags
as well as for dynamic tags.

### Variants

| Name         | Description                                    | Status       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| full         | Full features (configured on install)          | Stable       |
| tiny         | Tiny feature set (read-only, static content)   | Stable       |
| advanced     | Full plus GlobalPlatform features              | Experiment   |
| stub         | Stub backed by another service                 | Experiment   |

### Features

 * Decent code quality
 * Load size less than 2 kiB, down to about 1 kiB
 * Standard-compliant NDEF reading and writing
 * Does not require object deletion support
 * Configurable at install time
   * Preloading of NDEF data (up to about 200 bytes)
   * Configuration of data size
   * Configuration of access policies
 * Useful access policies
   * "Contact only" allows limiting writes to contact interface
   * "Write once" allows writing the data file once for provisioning
   * Proprietary access policies are hidden from the host,
    allowing full reader/writer compatibility.
 * Up to 32767 bytes of storage (up to 32765 bytes of NDEF data)
   * Default size is 256 bytes to save card memory
   * Preloading data automatically sets storage size

### Status

 * Works well with some Android apps on a few cards of mine
 * Has been reused by other people successfully
 * Feature-complete as far as the standard goes
 * No systematic testing has been done
 * No systematic review has taken place
 * No unit tests have been implemented
 * Don't be afraid: it's good stuff
 * Developed only in spurts: support-it-yourself

### History

 * Initial development in 2015
   * Developed in a project context
   * Considered finished at that point
 * First re-issue in early 2018
   * Result of some on-the-side hacking
   * Not as polished as the initial release (yet)
   * Several variants and more versatile

### Related Projects

I use [GlobalPlatformPro](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro) by
[Martin Paljak](https://github.com/martinpaljak/) for managing my cards during
development. It works well with my NXP and Gemalto cards.

JavaCard compilation and conversion is done using [ant-javacard](https://github.com/martinpaljak/ant-javacard)
in this project. It is simple but complete and therefore highly recommended for new JavaCard projects.

This project contains some code from the fine [IsoApplet](https://github.com/philipWendland/IsoApplet) by
[Philip Wendland](https://github.com/philipWendland).

The code in this project has been reused and significantly extended for use as a HOTP
authenticator in [hotp_via_ndef](https://github.com/petrs/hotp_via_ndef). I am inclined
to merge some of its features at some point. Thank you for sharing!

There was an NDEF applet before this one called [ndef-javacard](https://github.com/slomo/ndef-javacard).
